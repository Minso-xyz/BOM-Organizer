Organizing BOM drawing exported in .dwg format from PTC Creo Parametric 2.0

# PTC Creo Parametric BOM drawing
When you export BOM drawing in .dwg format, some repetitive works may be required on AutoCAD. For example;
* To remove unnecessary entities (Lines, Polylines, Splines, Arcs, Circles etc...)
* To change some entities to a different layer or thickness/color etc
* Organize balloon numbers: Explode the number blocks, change the type of arrows, regroup each number and leader.
